"""Does each part's symbol name its pins as the maker does?  For every part with an LCSC code, compare the pin names
on our schematic symbol (the one embedded in hardware/motorpid.kicad_sch) with the names on EasyEDA's symbol for the
same code (scripts/easyeda.py: the drawing JLCPCB's catalogue shows, usually copied from the datasheet), pin number
by pin number.

    python3 scripts/check_pinouts.py

AMOD-and-RFMOD's check_pinouts.py (CLAUDE_PCB.md section 26), with the polarised two-pin parts kept (a diode's K and
A, an electrolytic's + and -): on this board they are where a pin-number mistake would hurt.  A pin-number fit
(check_rotations.py) cannot see a symbol that carries another part's pinout.  Names are compared after normalising
(case, punctuation, the usual synonyms); a part whose names disagree is printed side by side for a person to read
against the datasheet.  Like check_rotations.py it needs the network the first time, so ./make.py does not run it.
